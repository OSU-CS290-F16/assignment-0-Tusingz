<li> The biggest challenge of this assignment was understanding how to use git and also learning basic HTML. Since I have only worked in software developement, I have no prior HTML experience. </li>

<li> I learned how to use git in command line. I was also able to learn basic HTML Programming. This provieded me with some basic information allowing me to complete the assignment. I already knew how to use my text editors and PUTTY but other than that I didn't know anything. </li>
